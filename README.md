Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client, The Gaming Room, wanted a cross-platform game app called “Draw It or Lose It.” They needed a solution that could run on different devices with a focus on consistency and performance.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I  organized the requirements and provided  explanations of the design choices, so everything was easy to follow and checed all of the boxes for the client.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Creating the design document helped by giving me a clear roadmap. It outlined the key features, making the coding process more straightforward,

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I’d revise the section on potential risks and strategies, adding more details and examples to prepare for issues during development.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on the requirements they provided, then translated those into specific features in the design.  Userr needs is crucial because it makes sure the final product is useful and meets any expectations.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached the design by breaking down the requirements into smaller tasks and mapping out the system architecture. In the future, I’d use skills like flow diagrams and wireframes to visualize the design and better plan the user experience.
